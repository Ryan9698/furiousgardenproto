      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p> Welcome to the Furious Garden. My name is Ryan and I'm an avid grower of plants of all kinds. It's a passion
        of mine and I enjoy growing the plants that are curious and tell a story. I'm passionate about all plants, from
        carnivorous plants to bonsai trees and I grow many of them. This is a store, but I intend for it to be much 
        more than that. I hope you enjoy your visit and come back to see what new things I have in store. Stay tuned!

        - Ryan
