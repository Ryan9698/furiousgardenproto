      <h1>About FG and Myself</h1>

      <p>Hey everyone,</p>

      <p>
        I wanted to share a bit about myself, what's happening here, and my
        plans for this site.
      </p>

      <p>
        My name is Ryan, and I'm a grower, just like you, with a passion for
        plants. For me, it started with bonsai trees and my fascination with
        their miniature concept and the harmony and balance they can project.
        They tell a story, and the older they get, the more interesting that
        story becomes. I've always loved that. My journey began with growing
        seeds from one of those "grow your own bonsai" kits. It wasn't until
        weeks in, after half of them germinated and tons of research, that I
        realized half of them wouldn't make decent trees and the other half
        weren't suitable for my climate. However, it didn't really matter
        because I was hooked from the moment the first ones germinated. I've met
        many others who caught the gardening bug in a similar way.
      </p>

      <p>
        My interest expanded to carnivorous plants when I sought a "creative"
        solution for gnats in my indoor grow space, and that rabbit hole was
        even deeper. At some point, it became about any peculiar plant that had
        something interesting about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This passion brought me here. Like many of you, I'm a passionate grower
        and have been a member of several communities over my time as a grower.
        While each had something to offer, I felt some aspects were missing. The
        carnivorous plant community is amazing, with many of the best growers
        leading conservation efforts or happily sharing their knowledge and
        propagating the hobby and culture. I've always admired that and wanted
        to bring those people together on a more modern platform. Many
        communities operate through forums or possibly discord servers. While
        great, they are more private and harder to find and access. My goal here
        is to create something that goes far beyond just a regular store.
      </p>

      <p>
        I plan to create a platform that allows users to share their plants with
        others, to communicate in real-time through chat rooms and forums. I
        want to offer users the ability to sell through my platform, as well as
        a place for people to trade and discuss the hobby because that's what
        it's all about for me when I think of the community. Over time, I hope
        to enable users to have their own stores with their own products if they
        wish to reach a broader audience. I also want to offer the ability to
        review, rate, and comment on products and experiences. I plan to add
        information about commonly cultivated plants and easy ways to take care
        of them. Additionally, I aim to provide videos on how I personally
        address issues that arise from growing, particularly with sick or dying
        plants and propagation.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see, I have grand plans for what I hope this will become. I'm
        a web developer, but I still have a ways to go. However, it's my dream
        to do this, and I hope that you all stay tuned for the journey. I'll
        post updates regularly through my "Blog" to keep everyone informed about
        what I'm up to. Good growing! - Ryan
