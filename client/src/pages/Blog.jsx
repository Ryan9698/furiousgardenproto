        I'm currently building the foundation for my site and at this point the
        site is not live. I'm still in that create phase and bridging together
        the elements and figuring out exactly how I'm going to get to the goal.
        I'm very excited about it at the moment and I'm working on it every
        chance I get. Honestly, I wrote this one more for myself to record where
        I am in the project and to remember this post when I encounter the
        difficulties in this process I'm surely going to. Web design, especially
        for an amateur is a tedious process but I'm still very much looking
        forward to seeing this develop and what it ends up being at the end of
        the journey. -Ryan
